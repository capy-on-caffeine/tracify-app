# Say hello to tracify
Lost an item? Fret not!
Tracify is here to make it easy

# How it works?
Imagine you lost a laptop. All you need to do is go to tracify and login. Now report your missing item by describing it.
Let's say you lost a silver Dell Inspiron with a dent on its back. Tracy will automatically extract these keywords from your desription and store it.
Now when someone finds your item, they'll enter the description too and keywords will be generated.
Now these keywords will be matched to find your item and you'll be notified.

# What if I can't find my item?
Can't find it? Raise a bounty for finding it. Super simple.
